Push_swap - Sorting algorithm using two stacks!

Push Swap

# Subject

Push_swap is a sorting game that requires two programs :

push_swap : You only have two stacks to help you to sort. At first, a stack (called Stack A) contains a certain amount of unduplicated integers and a second one (Stack B) is empty. The goal is to have all the numbers sorted in increasing order in Stack A. The output of the program is a list of instructions.
checker : read the instructions and execute them. It checks if Stack A is correctly sorted and Stack B empy. It sends "OK" to stdin if it is the case, otherwise it sends "KO".
Instructions are pre-defined by the subject and are the only reference to measure the performance of both programs during the peer-evaluation. Of course the less, the better. There are 4 types of instructions :

push (pa, pb) : moves the first element of a stack to the beginning of the other one
swap (sa, sb, ss) : swap the two first elements of a stack
rotate (ra, rb, rr) : first element comes last
reverse rotate (rra, rrb, rrr) : last element comes first
The instruction is ignored if the instruction cannot be executed (for instance if the stack is empty).

Allowed functions : write, read, malloc, free, exit
